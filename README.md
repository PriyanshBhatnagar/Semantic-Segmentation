# Semantic-Segmentation

The aim of semantic segmentation is - classifying every pixel of an image to corresponding class of what the pixel represents.

In this project, we have - 
<br>• Implemented Fully Convolutional Networks from scratch (Naive - FCN32) to perform semantic segmentation on CMP Facade database.
<br>• Improved performance by using skip connections with FCN-8 architecture to recover high level features.
<br>• Achieved a final IoU(intersection over union) of 0.46 & average pixel-wise test accuracy of 72%.
